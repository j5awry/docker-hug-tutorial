# Docker Hug Tutorial Github Page

This uses the Minimal Theme (links and license below) with some specific changes to the basic template (more Dr. Jekyll than Mr. Hyde, I hope). Now uses includes, layouts, and posts.

Each lesson is contained in a post. Easier to sort that way. They're sorted by the "order" keyword in the YAML metadata.
